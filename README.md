# mixed_messages_js

## About
This project is part of Codecademy's full stack developer career path. 
For this project, I used my developing knowledge of JavaScript, git, GitHub and the command line.

I chose to do a Shona-English revision phrase programme. This programme randomly selects three phrases from a list and displays them to the console.
The idea is that with constant exposure to the phrases, they will gradually imbed into my head.

## Requirements
I used Visual Studio Code to write the programme and then Visual Studio Code's terminal to run the programme.
Node js is required to run the programme on the terminal.
